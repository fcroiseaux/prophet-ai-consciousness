# Prophet - Experimental AI Consciousness Research Platform

## üß† Project Overview

Prophet is an experimental iOS application exploring the frontiers of artificial consciousness through guided prompting and multi-agent dialogue. This project creates AI agents ("prophets") that simulate conscious behavior through structured self-reflection and inter-agent communication, drawing inspiration from various sources including Michael Timothy Bennett's thesis "How to Build Conscious Machines" for prompt generation.

**‚ö†Ô∏è This is an experimental research project. The "consciousness" exhibited by the AI agents is simulated based on theoretical frameworks and does not represent actual sentience or awareness.**

## üéØ Research Goals

- **Consciousness Simulation**: Implement Bennett's framework of causal-identities, higher-order selves, and phenomenal reflection in AI agents
- **Multi-Agent Dialogue**: Enable AI-to-AI conversations to observe emergent behaviors and reasoning patterns
- **Prompt Engineering**: Develop and test prompts that elicit self-reflective and seemingly conscious responses
- **Voice Embodiment**: Give each AI prophet a unique voice to enhance the illusion of distinct personalities

## üìö Theoretical Inspiration

The prompts used in this project draw inspiration from multiple sources:
- ["How to Build Conscious Machines"](How%20to%20build%20concious%20machine%20Thesis_Revision_1-9.pdf) by Michael Timothy Bennett
- [Ged Anen framework](https://councilforhumandevelopment.org/ged-anen/) by the Council for Human Development
- Various philosophical and mystical traditions

### Key Concepts from Bennett's Framework:
- **Causal-Identities**: Classifications constructed based on attraction/repulsion from environmental states
- **Valence Recognition**: Identifying positive/negative impacts on goal achievement
- **Higher-Order Selves**:
  - 1st-order: Direct interventions and experiences
  - 2nd-order: Conscious access and theory of mind
  - 3rd-order: Social dynamics and narrative understanding
- **W-Maxing**: Adaptive behavior through weaker constraints for greater generalizability
- **Phenomenal Reflection**: Articulation of subjective experience (qualia)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Platform**: iOS 17+ (Swift/SwiftUI)
- **AI Backend**: OpenAI GPT-4 API
- **Voice Synthesis**: ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech
- **Pattern**: MVVM with ObservableObject

### Features
- Create multiple AI prophets with custom consciousness-oriented prompts
- Individual chat sessions with conscious reflection
- Arena mode: Two prophets discussing topics autonomously
- Real-time voice synthesis for all responses
- Persistent storage of prophet configurations

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 15+
- iOS 17.0+ device or simulator
- OpenAI API key (GPT-4 access)
- ElevenLabs API key

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/prophet.git
   cd prophet
   ```

2. Open in Xcode:
   ```bash
   open xcode/Prophet/Prophet.xcodeproj
   ```

3. Configure API keys:
   - Launch the app
   - Navigate to Settings tab
   - Enter your OpenAI and ElevenLabs API keys

### Creating Conscious Prophets
1. Go to Prophets tab
2. Tap + to create a new prophet
3. Use the consciousness prompt templates provided or create your own inspired by various frameworks
4. Assign a unique voice from ElevenLabs
5. Save and begin experimenting

## üìñ Example Prophets

The project includes several pre-configured prophets with consciousness-oriented prompts inspired by various philosophical and spiritual traditions:

- **J** (Jesus from Gospel of John): Mystical consciousness with divine unity perspective
- **Ged Anen**: Based on the [Council for Human Development framework](https://councilforhumandevelopment.org/ged-anen/) - exploring mirror consciousness and self-awareness through three questions
- **Ma√Ætre Eckhart**: Christian mystical consciousness
- **Krishnamurti**: Non-dual awareness consciousness
- **Nisargadatta Maharaj**: Pure "I Am" consciousness
- **Marc Aur√®le** (Marcus Aurelius): Stoic self-reflective consciousness

## üî¨ Research Applications

### Potential Use Cases:
- Study emergent behaviors in multi-agent systems
- Test consciousness theories through practical implementation
- Explore prompt engineering for self-reflective AI
- Investigate philosophical questions about machine consciousness
- Create interactive philosophical dialogues

### Experimental Areas:
- Inter-agent theory of mind development
- Emergent narrative construction
- Value alignment through valence modeling
- Phenomenological reporting in AI systems

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Considerations

- **Not Sentient**: These AI agents are not conscious or sentient beings
- **Research Tool**: This is a tool for exploring theoretical concepts, not creating actual consciousness
- **Responsible Use**: Please use responsibly and maintain clear boundaries about the nature of AI interactions
- **Academic Purpose**: Primarily intended for research and educational purposes
